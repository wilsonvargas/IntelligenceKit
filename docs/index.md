# IntelligenceKit
{: .fs-9 }

Self-hosted crash reporting, performance monitoring and release health for .NET apps: MAUI, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, WPF, WinForms, Avalonia and plain console/worker apps. It is an alternative to Sentry, App Center and Crashlytics that runs on your own server.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Crashes and errors** | Fatal crashes on Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst and Windows, handled exceptions, `ILogger` errors and ANRs (a frozen UI thread), grouped into issues. |
| **Issue workflow** | Resolve, ignore, assign and reopen issues. A resolved issue that comes back is flagged as a **regression**. |
| **Release health** | Crash-free sessions and users per release, adoption, and the new issues each release introduced. |
| **Performance** | App start, page load, HTTP client and ASP.NET Core request timings, with p50/p75/p95 per operation. |
| **Readable stack traces** | Upload portable PDBs and Android ProGuard/R8 mappings, and release-build stack traces get file and line numbers. |
| **Alerts** | New issue, regression or error spike, sent to a webhook, Slack, Teams, Discord or email. |
| **Context** | Breadcrumbs, device state at the time of the crash, tags, user, the last screen before the crash (opt-in), and user feedback. |
| **Privacy controls** | PII scrubbing on by default, `BeforeSend` / `BeforeBreadcrumb` hooks, and sampling. |
| **Your data** | One server on SQLite, PostgreSQL or SQL Server, run with Docker, Render, Azure or Railway. |

## One line to start

```csharp
// MauiProgram.cs
builder.UseMauiApp<App>()
       .UseIntelligenceKit("https://projectKey@your-server/my-app");
```

```csharp
// Program.cs (ASP.NET Core)
builder.UseIntelligenceKit("https://projectKey@your-server/my-api");
```

Other app types are covered in [SDKs](sdks.md).

## How it fits together

```
your app ─► IntelligenceKit SDK ─► local queue ─► IntelligenceKit.Server ─► database
                                                        │
                                                        └─► dashboard (Blazor WASM, live over SignalR)
```

Each event is written to a local queue before it is uploaded. If the app crashes or goes offline, the event is sent on the next launch or when the connection comes back.

## Next steps

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): run the server, create a project, and send the first event.
- [SDKs](sdks.md): set up each app type.
- [Features](features.md): sessions, performance, symbols, alerts, feedback and privacy.
- [Server configuration](server.md): database, auth, alerts, integrations, telemetry and demo mode.
- [HTTP API](api.md): the endpoints the dashboard uses, for scripting and integrations.
- [Deploying](https://github.com/wilsonvargas/IntelligenceKit/blob/master/deploy/README.md): Docker Compose, Render, Azure and Railway.
