# Changelog

All notable changes to IntelligenceKit are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The public API of the `IntelligenceKit.Core` and `IntelligenceKit.Maui` NuGet packages
is what SemVer applies to (see [Versioning](README.md#versioning-and-api-stability)).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-24

The SDK API is extended, not changed. Apps built against 1.0 compile and run unchanged.

> **Upgrade the server first.** A 1.1 SDK also sends session, performance-span and
> feedback events. A 1.0 server stores them as ordinary events, so they clutter the
> Events and Issues pages and give no crash-free rates, spans or feedback. A 1.1 server routes
> them properly. It migrates its database on startup.

### Added

- **Issue lifecycle**: resolve (optionally *in a release*), ignore, reopen and assign
  issues (`PATCH /issues/{id}`). A resolved issue that gets a new event is reopened
  and flagged as a **regression**, unless the event comes from an older release than
  the fix. Issues record the release that introduced them and the latest release seen.
- **Alerts**: rules for new issues, regressions and event-count thresholds, sent to
  a signed webhook, Slack, Teams, Discord or email (SMTP), with a per-issue cooldown,
  delivery history and a test button.
- **Sessions and crash-free rates**: automatic session tracking in every SDK;
  crash-free sessions and users on the Overview (`GET /stats/crash-free`).
- **Release health**: a Releases page with adoption, crash-free rates, session and
  exception counts, and the new issues each release introduced (`GET /releases`).
- **ANR detection**: a UI-thread watchdog in MAUI, WPF, WinForms and Avalonia reports
  `ApplicationNotResponding` when the UI is frozen longer than `AnrThreshold`.
- **Symbolication**: upload portable PDBs and Android R8/ProGuard mappings
  (`POST /symbols`, or automatically after a Release build with
  `IntelligenceKitUploadSymbols=true`). Release stack traces get file and line
  numbers, and Java frames are deobfuscated.
- **Privacy and volume controls**: `BeforeSend`, `BeforeBreadcrumb`, `SampleRate`,
  and PII scrubbing, which is on by default (`EnablePiiScrubbing`,
  `ScrubbingSensitiveKeys`, `ScrubbingPatterns`).
- **Performance monitoring**: app start, page load, HTTP client
  (`AddIntelligenceKitHandler()`) and ASP.NET Core request spans, plus
  `IPerformanceMonitor.StartSpan` for your own. A Performance page shows p50, p75,
  p95 and failure rate.
- **Better grouping**: issues are grouped by the top *in-app* frame instead of
  framework frames. Log events are grouped by message template. Custom fingerprints
  are supported (`IntelligenceEvent.Fingerprint`, with `{{ default }}`), and
  `POST /admin/issues/backfill` regroups stored events.
- **New packages**: `IntelligenceKit.Extensions.Logging` (ILogger provider),
  `IntelligenceKit.Hosting` (console apps, workers, services),
  `IntelligenceKit.AspNetCore`, `IntelligenceKit.Blazor`, `IntelligenceKit.Wpf`,
  `IntelligenceKit.WinForms` and `IntelligenceKit.Avalonia`.
- **MAUI on Windows and Mac Catalyst**, alongside Android and iOS.
- **User feedback**: `CaptureFeedbackAsync` and `LastEventId`, and an opt-in prompt
  after a crash in MAUI (`EnableCrashFeedbackPrompt`). Feedback appears on events and
  issues.
- **Search and filters**: status tabs and text search on Issues; text, level,
  environment, release, platform, OS, device, user, tag and date filters on Events.
- **Issue insights**: distributions by platform, OS, device, manufacturer, release,
  environment and tags; affected users; and a per-user timeline page.
- **Projects page** in the dashboard: create projects, copy the DSN, rotate read
  keys and delete projects.
- **Export and issue trackers**: CSV/JSON export of events and issues; create a
  GitHub issue (prefilled form or API) or a Jira issue from an issue.
- **Server observability**: `/health/live` and `/health/ready` probes, Prometheus
  `/metrics`, and optional OTLP export.
- **Deployment**: server and dashboard images on GitHub Container Registry (amd64 and
  arm64), `$PORT` support, and one-click templates for Render, Azure App Service and
  Railway. The server also accepts `postgres://` URLs and `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Demo mode**: `Demo:Seed` fills an empty database with sample data, and
  `Demo:ReadOnly` rejects all writes (`docker-compose.demo.yml`).
- **Documentation site** built from `docs/` and published to GitHub Pages.

### Changed

- `IIntelligenceKit` gained `CaptureFeedbackAsync` and `LastEventId` as default
  interface members, so existing implementations still compile.
- `HttpIntelligenceClient` moved to `IntelligenceKit.Core`, so every SDK can use it.
  The MAUI type of the same name remains for compatibility.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-19

First stable release. The API is now frozen under SemVer.

### Added

- **MAUI SDK** — automatic crash reporting on Android & iOS (typed, nested
  `ExceptionInfo`), offline store-and-forward queue, rich context (breadcrumbs,
  device runtime snapshot, tags/user/environment/release), opt-in last-screen
  capture, and `TrackLogAsync`. One-line setup: `builder.UseIntelligenceKit(dsn)`.
- **Backend** — minimal-API ingest/query server on EF Core with **SQLite,
  PostgreSQL and SQL Server** providers; idempotent ingest; **issue grouping** by
  fingerprint; real-time **SignalR** push; errors-per-hour and per-project stats.
- **Per-project scoping (multi-tenant)** — a `Project` registry with a per-project
  read key that sees only its own data, plus an admin-only management API
  (`/admin/projects` create/list/rotate-key/delete). The global admin token still
  sees everything. Read endpoints and the SignalR hub filter by the caller's scope.
- **Ingest hardening** — per-client-IP rate limiting (`429` + `Retry-After`, config
  under `RateLimit:Ingest`) and known-project validation (config
  `Ingest:RequireKnownProject`).
- **Data retention** — an opt-in background sweep prunes events/screenshots and
  stale issues older than `Retention:Days`.
- **Dashboard** — Blazor WebAssembly live feed + charts.
- **Ops** — one-command Docker Compose stack (PostgreSQL + server + dashboard),
  GitHub Actions CI, and a 102-test suite (Core unit + Server integration).

### Changed

- **BREAKING (since `0.1.0-alpha`): ingest now validates the project by default.**
  `POST /events` only accepts events whose `(projectId, projectKey)` pair matches a
  project registered via `POST /admin/projects`; unknown projects get `404`. Set
  `Ingest:RequireKnownProject: false` to keep ingest fully open as before.
- **Read-side auth** is no longer a single shared token only: a presented credential
  is resolved to either the admin token (sees all) or a per-project read key (scoped).
  The existing admin-token flow is unchanged.
- The SDK now treats HTTP `429`/`408` as transient (store-and-forward retries them)
  instead of dropping the event, so ingest rate limiting never loses data.

### Security

- Read API, SignalR hub and dashboard remain gated (admin token or project read key);
  open in Development when unset, fail-closed in Production.
- Project read keys are stored only as a SHA-256 hash and shown once at
  creation/rotation.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-18

- Initial alpha packages (`IntelligenceKit.Core`, `IntelligenceKit.Maui`) published to
  NuGet. End-to-end SDK → server → dashboard flow with crash reporting, offline
  store-and-forward, rich context, last-screen capture, multi-provider backend,
  real-time dashboard, read-side auth and issue grouping.
